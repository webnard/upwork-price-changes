Upload your [lifetime_earnings_by_client.csv](https://www.upwork.com/ab/payments/reports/relationship-values/csv)
file to your Google Drive and open as a Google Spreadsheet. From the dropdown
menu, choose Tools → Script Editor... and in the new window, copy and paste
the code found in the Code.gs file.

Run it from the script editor by choosing Run → calcGouge. Your spreadsheet
will now pop up with a modal showing you how much you paid previously to
Upwork vs. how much you would have paid if all of these earnings were made
post June 2016.
